environment_variables:
  STORAGE_MODE:
    default: local
    description: >-
      This variable designates whether the project uses external data ('external') or from the preprocessed dataset included
      in the repo ('local'). If this variable is set to 'external', the user must have access to a CDW Catalog that has samples deployed.
  SPARK_CONNECTION_NAME:
    default: na
    description: >-
      Relative path that will be used to store the data used for this prototype.
      This should be a location you have write access to, and which is suitable for non-production data.
  DW_DATABASE:
    default: airlines
    description: >-
      Name of the database that the flight data is available in.
  DW_TABLE:
    default: flighs
    description: >-
      Name of data warehouse table that holds the flights data. The prototype supports both hive and iceberg table formats.
