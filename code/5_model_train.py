# The following script loads the sampled dataset that was created in 3_data_processing.py (or loads
# the locally saved version if STORAGE_MODE=local) and trains an XGBoost classification model to predict
# if a flight will be cancelled based on a selected set of input features

# Note - This script simply trains an XGBoost model, but does not tune hyperparameters. In practice,
# thoughtful consideration should be spent optimizing a model for the proper set of evaluation metrics.
